# next/roadmap
- read & validate tosca files ("validate")
  - currently there is no proper tosca parser in go (that also supports the latest spec). Sad.
    - https://github.com/owulveryck/toscalib specific for simple-profile, generic tosca is "builtin"
    - https://github.com/reallyroy/toscalib fork of first, 5 commits ahead, some minor additions & doc updates
    - https://github.com/dciangot/toscalib fork of first, 4 commits ahead, some minor fixes
- detect current state (dummy-version)
  - hw detection
- constraint & fulfillment detection (OPA?)
- installing OS (ipmi?)
- installing application (ssh?)

hw-detection & OS could be swapped/combined (at least for MVP), but with hw-detection step the whole system is more versatile.

# demo
- show empty vm list of hypervisor
- create vms via script & tell about simulating ipmi tooling for vms
- start eat
