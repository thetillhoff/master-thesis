# last time todos
- scope of extension / roadmap
- out of scope

# scope

## lower limit
- one provider (bare metal)
  - everywhere the same
  - same backend layers exist everywhere but some are abstracted away depending on provider
- No cabling
  - only abstract network
- No hw-parts except
  - processor needed
  - ram needed
  - disk needed
  - psu not needed (assume one by default)
  - nic not needed


## upper limit
- two applications (webapp + db)
  - high-available (2-nodes, failover)
  - scalable
  - works with public access, processing, storage and clustering (cross-node-interactions)


## horizontal scope/limit
- one hardware-type, one software-type (one OS, one webserver, one db)
- price-estimation (with fixed "random" prices) (template for power-estimation, ...)
- check for compatibility between high-level app and lower-level iac


## questionable
- networking(-hw) (router, switch, load-balancer, ...)
  - only what is needed
- hypervisor/containers? maybe as example on how multiple types would work for everything


# constraints
- dummy-hardware
  - no real hardware, statefile update only
  - software deployments are real
- enable overridable defaults

# roadmap
- bottom-up
  - hw first
    - power-on/-off
    - detect parts like cpu, ram, disk
    - network topology
  - software second
    - os
    - storage config
  - abstract networking
  - price last

# next
- one os deployment-tool like cloud-init
- "application-streaming" (diff after installation) e.g. https://www.numecent.com/ (hw-admin)
- remote-ssh
- 3rd party integrations like openapi, ansible

webapp like wordpress on bare-metal hw
