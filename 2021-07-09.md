## Done
- DSLs tested and compared:
  Which:
    - AWS CloudFormation
    - OpenStack Heat
    - Hashicorp Terraform
    - Tosca / cloudify
    - Tosca / simple-profile
  Compared by:
    - approach
      - "parent language": json, yaml, hcl
    - hidden-dependencies
      - provider-cli
    - structure
    - validation/error-reporting
      - more than yaml-linting
    - aspects to learn
      - intuitivity, parent language, special product names, special parameters
    - tooling/ecosystem
      - ide-integration
      - cli / lib / gui
    - optimizations
      - parallelism
    - extensibility
      - plug-in architecture
    - guarantees
      - rollback / atomicity
      - typing
    - reusability of components
      - app, app-components, redundancy, variables
    - visibility
      - intuitive structure, names, single-source-of-truth
    - viscosity
      - versioning, packaging, name/id
    - consistency
      - cloud-agnostic dsl
  Notes:
    additional tools:
      - ystia/yorc: many providers, but only basic featureset (vm, disk, public ip)
      - alien4cloud: gui only, very strange documentation
  Result:
    there are two types so far:
      - cli, where the dsl is "not perfect" (cloudformation, heat)
        - hcl vs yaml https://xkcd.com/927/
          - (?) hcl to json is hard (ref?), yaml to json is easy
          - hcl is optimized for terraform and other hashicorp products
          - hcl tooling isn't good (even basic linting doesnt exist/work)
          - there is hcl.json as a json-compatible version of hcl
      - "perfect dsl" without cli tools and undefined everything as a service (tosca)
        - flexible dsl, with a lot potential
        - not all potential components / capabilities are added (yet)
    potential main goals:
      - implement cli tool for tosca(-extension) (and design corresponding everything-as-a-service reference definitions)
      - implement tosca parser for terraform/hcl
    additional goals possible:
      - implement one or two reference providers (direct)

## Next
- extend tosca standard
  - pxe deployment
  - overall deployment
  - api description
  - user "management" f.e. depend on kerberos (left&right)
  - ideas for extensions
  - define "everything"
- why is deployment featureset missing
