# programming questions
- how to "parse" units? there was one example where time-units are possible IIRC -> go-lib "bytefmt", and time.Parse...

# last time todos
- read & validate tosca files (`validate`)
- find or create own tosca-lib in go
  - https://github.com/owulveryck/toscalib specific for simple-profile, generic tosca is "builtin"
    Also for older spec version. Many changes necessary, needs checking against complete spec
  - https://github.com/reallyroy/toscalib fork of first, 5 commits ahead, some minor additions & doc updates
  - https://github.com/dciangot/toscalib fork of first, 4 commits ahead, some minor fixes
  - currently there is no proper tosca parser in go (that also supports the latest spec). Sad.
  -> created own (see #done)
- detect current state (dummy-version)
  - hw detection
- constraint & fulfillment detection (OPA?)
- installing OS (ipmi?)
- installing application (ssh?)

hw-detection & OS could be swapped/combined (at least for MVP), but with hw-detection step the whole system is more versatile.

# done
- cmd tool
  - validation command `go run . validate <csarPath>`
- go-lib for tosca csar spec
  - functions for reading csar archives either from folder or zip-files (latter needed to conform to spec)
- go-lib for tosca spec
  - tagged structs
  - read service template, validate content/structure/types
  - print/generate valid service templates
- go-lib for tosca-simple-profile spec with tagged structs
  - additional types/structs, based on tosca-types
  - simple-profile.yaml which contains types definitions required for (later) imports
  - lib might be unnecessary though

# next/roadmap
At least reading whole service templates is necessary to detect wheter it contains unsupported features.
From now on, only necessary code will be implemented (in Processor/Orchestrator).
Optimal MVP detects missing feature and will fail before trying.
---
- [x] go-code for parsing basic tosca.
- [WIP] go-code for dynamic type-loading is needed. This includes imports.
  - imports will be limited to local files. No https.
- [?] go-code for functions like get_input are needed.
  - Will only implement those needed for demo.
- [?] go-code for conformance checking is needed. (constraints etc.)
  - Not planned during MA.
- [ ] go-code for operations/implementations are needed.
  - Limited to bash. No python.
---
- [ ] detect current state (dummy-version?)
  - hardware-detection (read-only iso with predefined scripts in autostart)
    - either check constraints of serviceTemplate against existing hardware (x nodes of type y with capability z)
    - or create inventar / state (tosca doesn't have a state defined, but could be an extension)
  - Limited to one hypervisor (KVM/QEMU or HyperV?)
  - Limited information only (as poc only)
- [ ] constraint & fulfillment detection (via OPA?)
  - this will be implemented in go/tosca. Requirements & Capabilities are meant for this. No OPA for you.
- [ ] installing OS (via ipmi?)
- [ ] installing application (via ssh?)
---
Notes/Ideas for implementation:
- To control hardware, toscas "implementations" could be used. Whether those bash-scripts run ipmi commands or configure kvm vms doesn't really matter (for a poc).
- For hardware-detection, debian live (https://www.debian.org/CD/live/) could be used. Editing the iso with custom autostart files might be a simple way.
  - Options:
    - debian live iso with custom script in autostart -> already >900MB and iso contains squashfs for live system. hard to edit. add scriptpath to /etc/rc.local.
    - netboot.xyz iso -> no custom script possible
    - minimal linux live -> perfect match! allows for custom startup-script (.sh) additions (tutorial at https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal/blob/master/src/minimal_overlay/bundles/mll_hello/bundle.sh), has 18 MB and supports bios and uefi.
  - script:
    - `cat /proc/cpuinfo`
    - `cat /proc/meminfo`

  - Result should either be:
    - Inventar of hardware (similar to statefile)
    - Enabling constraint checking of "to-be-installed" application against hardware. poc-level would be "has cpu" "has x sized disk" "has x sized ram"


# further ideas
- vscode extension, i.e. tosca language server, creating tooltips according to comments/descriptions of imports and already defined types.
- best-practice / recommendation when something should be in a node, in a capability, in a relationship, in a property, in an attribute, ....

## tosca processor
- Can parse and recognize the elements of any service template and generates errors when invalid
  -> metadata, yaml-validation, service-template conformance.
- Implements the requirements and semantics associated with definitions & grammar in section 3 (TOSCA definitions in YAML) including the "additional requirements"
  - actually, chapter 4 has that name... and contains 80% of the spec. -> let's see how far i get
- Resolves imports either explicit or implicit as described in section 3 (TOSCA definitions in YAML)
  - correct section is probably 4.2.3 (Imports and Namespaces)
    -> make the imports, namespace them correctly ("Root", "prefixed", "nested")
- Generates errors as required in error cases described in section 3.1 (TOSCA namespace URI and alias), 3.2 (Parameter and property type) and 3.6 (type-specific definitions)
  - no such sections, probably means 4.2.3 "imports and namespaces"
    -> probably means conformance to and error-checking according to chapter 4 including imports, namespaces, parameters, properties, attributes and type-specific structures
- normalizes string values as described in section 5.4.9.3 (additional requirements)
  -> I have no idea. Might be leftover from XML days.

-> processor means "advanced validator"

## tosca orchestrator
- Is a TOSCA processor
- Can process all types of artifacts described in section 5.3 (Artifact types) according to the rules and grammars in this section
  -> bash and python
- Can process TOSCA archives as intended in section 6 (TOSCA Cloud Service Archive(CSAR) format) and other related normative sections
  -> CSAR reader
- Can understand and process the functions defined in section 4 (TOSCA functions) according to their rules and semantics
  -> get_attribute, get_parameter, get_input etc
- Can understand and process the normative type definitions acording to their semantics and requirements as described in section 5 (TOSCA normative type definitions)
  -> 
- Can understand and process the networking types and semantics defined in section 7 (TOSCA networking)
- Generates errors as required in error cases described in sections 2.10 (Using node template substitution for chaining subsystems), 5.4 (Capabilities types) and 5.7 (Interface types)

-> orchestrator means "advanced validator, which also runs defined commands"
