# live-demo

## prerequisites

- some kind of hardware, either real or vms. (can this be done with vagrant? how many nodes can vagrant run a workstation?)
- one initial machine, like a linux laptop.
- cabling set up (power, network).

## vision

- have some policies in place, which are explained during the presentation
- test policies
- start some kind of software on initial machine
- boot all hardware pretty much at the same time
- make it possible to watch what happens and how fast everything is set up
  - PXE server running,
  - requests answered,
  - files sent,
  - names/ids created/used,
  - state(-updates) of all machines
  - state of (all) clusters
  - state of storage
  - application deployment
- when is everything done? When the exeutable exits? Or when a message is displayed?
- retrieve cluster access information, test application deployment
- tear-down
