# reintro
- tosca standard extension (hardware / bare-metal)
- orchestrator

# roadmap
At least reading whole service templates is necessary to detect wheter it contains unsupported features.
From now on, only necessary code will be implemented (in Processor/Orchestrator).

- [x] basic cmd-wrapper `go run . validate <csarPath>`
- [x] go-code for parsing & validating basic tosca.
- [x] find or create own tosca-lib in go
  - https://github.com/owulveryck/toscalib specific for simple-profile, generic tosca is "builtin"
    Also for older spec version. Many changes necessary, needs checking against complete spec
    (https://github.com/CiscoCloud/toscalib forks from this)
  - https://github.com/reallyroy/toscalib fork of first, 5 commits ahead, some minor additions & doc updates
  - https://github.com/dciangot/toscalib fork of first, 4 commits ahead, some minor fixes
  - currently there is no proper tosca parser in go (that also supports the latest spec). Sad.
  -> created own (see below)
  - [x] go-lib for tosca spec
    - tagged structs
    - read service template, validate content/structure/types
    - print/generate valid service templates
  - [x] go-lib for tosca csar spec
    - functions for reading csar archives either from folder or zip-files (latter needed to conform to spec)
  - ([x] go-lib for tosca-simple-profile spec with tagged structs)
- [WIP] go-code for dynamic type-loading is needed. This includes imports.
  - imports will be limited to local files. No https.
- [?] go-code for functions like get_input are needed.
  - Will only implement those needed for demo.
- [?] go-code for conformance checking is needed. (constraints etc.)
  - Not planned during MA.
- [ ] go-code for operations/implementations are needed.
  - Limited to bash. No python.
- [WIP] detect current state == hardware-detection (read-only iso with predefined scripts in autostart)
  - either check constraints of serviceTemplate against existing hardware (x nodes of type y with capability z)
  - or create inventar / state (tosca doesn't have a state defined, but could be an extension)
  - Limited to one hypervisor (KVM/QEMU or HyperV?)
  - Limited information only (as poc only)
    - cat /proc/cpuinfo, cat /proc/meminfo
- [ ] constraint & fulfillment (requirement/capability) detection (via OPA?)
  - Optimal MVP detects missing feature and will fail before trying.
  - This will be implemented in go/tosca. Requirements & Capabilities are meant for this. No OPA.
- [ ] installing OS (via ipmi?)
- [ ] installing application (via ssh?)

# further ideas
- WIP contact with openTOSCA-devs
- vscode extension, i.e. tosca language server, creating tooltips according to comments/descriptions of imports and already defined types.
- best-practice / recommendation when something should be in a node, in a capability, in a relationship, in a property, in an attribute, ....

# conformance levels
https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA/v2.0/csd03/TOSCA-v2.0-csd03.html#_Toc56506169

## tosca processor
- Can parse and recognize the elements of any service template and generates errors when invalid
  -> metadata, yaml-validation, service-template conformance.
- Implements the requirements and semantics associated with definitions & grammar in section 3 (TOSCA definitions in YAML) including the "additional requirements"
  - actually, chapter 4 has that name... and contains 80% of the spec. -> let's see how far i get
- Resolves imports either explicit or implicit as described in section 3 (TOSCA definitions in YAML)
  - correct section is probably 4.2.3 (Imports and Namespaces)
    -> make the imports, namespace them correctly ("Root", "prefixed", "nested")
- Generates errors as required in error cases described in section 3.1 (TOSCA namespace URI and alias), 3.2 (Parameter and property type) and 3.6 (type-specific definitions)
  - no such sections, probably means 4.2.3 "imports and namespaces"
    -> probably means conformance to and error-checking according to chapter 4 including imports, namespaces, parameters, properties, attributes and type-specific structures
- normalizes string values as described in section 5.4.9.3 (additional requirements)
  -> I have no idea. Might be leftover from XML days.

-> processor means "advanced validator"

## tosca orchestrator
- Is a TOSCA processor
- Can process all types of artifacts described in section 5.3 (Artifact types) according to the rules and grammars in this section
  -> bash and python
- Can process TOSCA archives as intended in section 6 (TOSCA Cloud Service Archive(CSAR) format) and other related normative sections
  -> CSAR reader
- Can understand and process the functions defined in section 4 (TOSCA functions) according to their rules and semantics
  -> get_attribute, get_parameter, get_input etc
- Can understand and process the normative type definitions acording to their semantics and requirements as described in section 5 (TOSCA normative type definitions)
  -> 
- Can understand and process the networking types and semantics defined in section 7 (TOSCA networking)
- Generates errors as required in error cases described in sections 2.10 (Using node template substitution for chaining subsystems), 5.4 (Capabilities types) and 5.7 (Interface types)

-> orchestrator means "advanced validator, which also runs defined commands"

# example
- inventarisierung der hw
  - snmp als "live-inventar"
- matching von requirements gegen inventar
- selection of fitting node
- deployment of os-image
- schnittstelle zwischen tosca und nocloud

- dhcp oder BMC deployment
- pxe example os

schnittstellen:
- get capabilities
- pxe deployment of iso -> first

szenario live-demo:
- eine mÃ¶gliche erweiterung (bspw hw) theoretisch beschreiben, dann zeigen
- ein neuer server mit image XY
- sucht passendes match aus und deployt dies

# own additions
- new type of tosca orchestrator: multiple orchestrators can run in parallel, not one centralized instance like before, but approach similar to terraform
  - new limitation: "race conditions" - how does terraform solve this?
  - solved limitation: easier development, lower hurdles to work with it
- "designing a (on-demand) tosca orchestrator"
- idea: merge node type and node template etc into "node" -> values can only be assigned via Set-Functions which validate them beforehand

# title ideas
- "autodetection and automatic deployment of hardware in infrastructure-as-code environments" (namely TOSCA)
- "combining the bare-metal provider and the TOSCA-orchestrator to extensible, self-contained bare-metal orchestrator"
