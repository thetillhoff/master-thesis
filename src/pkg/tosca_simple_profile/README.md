# `TOSCA Simple Profile`

This package aims to conform with the TOSCA Simple Profile 1.3 specification.

## Objective (taken from specification)
The TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML specifies a rendering of TOSCA which aims to provide a more accessible syntax as well as a more concise and incremental expressiveness of the TOSCA DSL in order to minimize the learning curve and speed the adoption of the use of TOSCA to portably describe cloud applications

As mentioned before, the TOSCA simple profile assumes the existence of a small set of pre-defined, normative set of node types (e.g., a ‘Compute’ node) along with other types, which will be introduced through the course of this document, for creating TOSCA Service Templates. It is envisioned that many additional node types for building service templates will be created by communities. Some may be published as profiles that build upon the TOSCA Simple Profile specification.
