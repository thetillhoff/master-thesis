# `TOSCA`

This package aims to conform with the TOSCA 2.0 specification.

## Objective (taken from specification)

Cloud computing can become more valuable if the creation and lifecycle management of application, infrastructure, and network services can be fully automated and supported across a variety of deployment environments. The core TOSCA specification provides a language for describing service components and their relationships using a service topology, and it provides for specifying the lifecycle management procedures that allow for creation or modification of services using orchestration processes. The combination of topology and orchestration in a Service Template describes what is needed in different environments to enable automated deployment of services and their management throughout the complete service lifecycle (e.g. scaling, patching, monitoring, etc.).
