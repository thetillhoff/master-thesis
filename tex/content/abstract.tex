Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a trend that applies software development techniques to infrastructure. Most currently available tools around it require a (cloud) backend that is available at all times and listens on API-calls like \textquote{I want X servers to be provisioned as Y}. But these backends have to be provisioned somehow as well. And at some level, hardware needs to be provisioned. A simple \textquote{Just give me a server X with Y} does not work here - or does it? This thesis tries to apply such IaC principles to hardware.

%TODO
% [Can infrastructure as code apply to bare metal]:
% Cloud APIs are beautiful, but "Just give me server" cannot be that simple in bare metal.
% heterogeneity in hardware makes it hard
% Think in reset, not provisions
% Pipelines are the key to IaC
% Provisioning and Configuration are mixed
% real world state as single source of truth
