\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{addmargin}[2em]{2em}
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a trend that applies software development techniques to infrastructure.
Most currently available tools in that area require a (cloud) backend that is available at all times and listens on API-calls like \textquote{I want X servers to be provisioned as Y}.
But these backends have to be provisioned as well.
And still, at some level, hardware needs to be provisioned.
A simple \textquote{Just give me a server X with Y} does not work here - or does it?
This thesis investigates whether bare-metal machines can be provisioned on-demand with orchestration software that also runs on-demand.
By doing so, the initially required manual setup could be eliminated or at least dramatically reduced.
To describe the virtual and physical infrastructure with a consistent language, a domain-specific language is selected and a systematic approach for integrating the description of hardware is developed.

%TODO
% [Can infrastructure as code apply to bare metal]:
% Cloud APIs are beautiful, but "Just give me server" cannot be that simple in bare metal.
% heterogeneity in hardware makes it hard
% Think in reset, not provisions
% Pipelines are the key to IaC
% Provisioning and Configuration are mixed
% real world state as single source of truth
