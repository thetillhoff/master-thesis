\chapter{Outlook}

This is the outlook
% aspects of mdsd workflow:
% - always:
%   - define modeling language (abstract and concrete syntax)
%   - tool support to define models
%   - persist models in files or dbs
%   - tranform models to text
% - often:
%   - transform model to model
%   - transform text to model
%   - analyze and interpret models
%   - automate workflows from single steps

% why meta models: allows to reuse technology for
% - storing models in files
% - storing models in dbs
% - creating a form-based editor
% - creating a graphical editor
% - generating code from models
% - transforming models into other models
% metamodel is used to describe abstract syntax, not concrete syntax!

% TODO outlook: vendor bioses should support http by default or use ipxe when network boot is selected - maybe even allow flashing ipxe remotely to a custom version. (or have the preinstalled version support all features, which requires custom builds from the source code). VMware does support this already: https://ipxe.org/howto/vmware

% api for bare-metal. It would be create to pass a standardized configuration to a bmc, which then provisions the host accordingly.
