\chapter{Design and Implementation} %  Design Principles and Architecture

- 5-10 pages
- goal: fellow student understands content and would be able to more or less reproduce work
- legitimate chosen approach
- develop own ideas, trace them to existing theories
- analysis & development
- why was the approach (algorithm/technique/...) chosen and how does it work
- show how concepts from theory are applied
- test setup & achieved results

possible steps:
- requirement study
- analysis / design -> UML, interaction, behavioural model, basic algorithms/methods, detailed description of models & their interactions (class/sequence diagrams)
- manual, how to use program/device
- system development & implementation
