## example
- inventarisierung der hw
  - snmp als "live-inventar"
- matching von requirements gegen inventar
- selection of fitting node
- deployment of os-image
- schnittstelle zwischen tosca und bare-metal

- pxe oder BMC deployment
- pxe example os

schnittstellen:
- get capabilities
- pxe deployment of iso -> first

szenario live-demo:
- eine m√∂gliche erweiterung (bspw hw) theoretisch beschreiben, dann zeigen
- ein neuer server mit image XY
- sucht passendes match aus und deployt dies

# roadmap

Also see `./live-demo-vision.md`.

- [x] dynamic type loading
- [x] go-code for functions like get_input
  - Will only implement those needed for demo.
- [-] go-code for conformance checking (constraints etc.)
  - Not planned during MA.
- [x] poc unattended os-installation
  - [x] iso with preseed
- [x] poc hardware-detection (==detect current state)
  - [x] dhcp
  - [x] tftp
  - [x] http
  - [x] kernel and iso creation
  - [x] putting together a docker container
- [WIP] integrating hardware-detection in orchestrator
  - [WIP] integrating docker calls
  - [ ] adding ssh
- [ ] installing application (via ssh)
- [WIP] go-code for operations/implementations
  - Limited to bash. No python.
- [ ] requirement & capability matching
  - Optimal MVP detects missing feature and will fail before trying.

# own additions
- bootstrap process for bare-metal; both the TOSCA and implementation side.
- new type of tosca orchestrator: Not an always-on architecture, but "on-demand".
  TOSCA was previously meant to access a provider and an orchestrator, now both is one and the same
  - solved limitation: easier development, lower hurdles to start and work with it
  - new limitation: "race conditions" - how does terraform solve this?
- simplifications of tosca:
  - merge types, templates and instances etc into one thing of everything:
    f.e. "node_type" and "node_template" and (only existing at runtime) node-instances
    Also applies (at least partially) on data_type, relationship_type, artifact_type, ...
    - values are assigned via single Setter-Function which validates each value beforehand instead of deriving, chained type-loading, ...
    - "Unset" variables can have three reasons:
      - When in type- or template-state, some values might not have an actual value yet
      - not required
      - default value
    - ? implementation: queue of tasks, where it is tested whether accessed value is filled; if not, delay

# further ideas
- [WIP] contact with openTOSCA-devs
- [ ] vscode extension, i.e. tosca language server, creating tooltips according to comments/descriptions of imports and already defined types.
- [ ] best-practice / recommendation when something should be in a node, in a capability, in a relationship, in a property, in an attribute, ....

# title ideas
- "designing a (on-demand) tosca orchestrator"
- "autodetection and automatic deployment of hardware in infrastructure-as-code environments" (namely TOSCA)
- "combining the bare-metal provider and the TOSCA-orchestrator to extensible, self-contained bare-metal orchestrator"

# next
- Finish Proof-of-Concept within this week!
- Define how hardware is mirrored in TOSCA
- concentrate on writing, write lot about the own additions, even the easy things
