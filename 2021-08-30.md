# roadmap

- [x] dynamic type loading
- [x] go-code for functions like get_input
  - Will only implement those needed for demo.
- [-] go-code for conformance checking (constraints etc.)
  - Not planned during MA.
- [x] poc unattended os-installation
  - [x] iso with preseed
- [x] poc hardware-detection (==detect current state)
  - [x] dhcp
  - [x] tftp
  - [x] http
  - [x] kernel and iso creation
  - [x] putting together a docker container
- [WIP] integrating hardware-detection in orchestrator
  - [WIP] integrating docker calls
  - [ ] adding ssh
- [ ] installing application (via ssh?)
- [ ] go-code for operations/implementations
  - Limited to bash. No python.
- [ ] requirement & capability matching
  - Optimal MVP detects missing feature and will fail before trying.

# further ideas
- [WIP] contact with openTOSCA-devs
- [ ] vscode extension, i.e. tosca language server, creating tooltips according to comments/descriptions of imports and already defined types.
- [ ] best-practice / recommendation when something should be in a node, in a capability, in a relationship, in a property, in an attribute, ....

# own additions
- new type of tosca orchestrator: multiple orchestrators can run in parallel, not one centralized instance like before, but approach similar to terraform
  - new limitation: "race conditions" - how does terraform solve this?
  - solved limitation: easier development, lower hurdles to work with it
- "designing a (on-demand) tosca orchestrator"
- idea: merge node type and node template etc into "node" -> values can only be assigned via Set-Functions which validate them beforehand

# title ideas
- "autodetection and automatic deployment of hardware in infrastructure-as-code environments" (namely TOSCA)
- "combining the bare-metal provider and the TOSCA-orchestrator to extensible, self-contained bare-metal orchestrator"

# next
concentrate on writing
