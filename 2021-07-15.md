# Last time

- extend tosca standard
  - pxe deployment
  - overall deployment
  - api description
  - user "management" f.e. depend on kerberos (left&right)
  - ideas for extensions
  - define "everything"
- why is deployment featureset missing

Results:
- pxe-poc (simple-profile is not simple)
- deployment is offloaded to orchestrator
  - lots of "the orchestrator must/should"
  - actual implementation is different for each software (create-vm.sh artifacts)
- "everything" not yet defined, but should work bottom up

# Done

## opentosca
demo and issues

## pxe in tosca

- pxe as application
- pxe as network (-> pxe enabled network)
- tosca is not yet meant for bare-metal use case and assumes the existence of an hypervisor (==provider) and an orchestrator to run at all times
  - orchestrator still only runs tasks periodically, so this design feels strange (and locked-in)
  - orchestrator is expected to do lots of things
- why noone had a getting started guide nor described how to manually create a topology:
  - there are hundreds of ways to describe everything
  - The spec itself is ambiguous sometimes
  - By doing it graphically:
    - The engine does it the same way every time
    - Properties & attributes are hard to distinguish (basically the same, but attributes are instantiated, properties are yet to be filled), so the engine does the work for the user by autoplacing them
  - files:
    - get_artifact: [SELF, zip]: "the orchestrator may provider the file as either a local URL (file://...) or remote one (http://...)"
    - get_artifact: [SELF, zip, LOCAL_FILE]: "the orchestrator must provider the file as a local path (/tmp/...) and will remove it after operation is completed" (latter can be turned off)
    - get_artifact: [SELF, zip, /tmp/...]: "the orchestrator must provide the file as a local path at the specified destination and will let it after operation is completed"

missing:
- plans (actual implementation details)
- ...

## api in tosca

- chapter 13.4.7 API artifacts is uncompleted. Later on, it is desired to support:
  - rest
  - soap
  - openapi
  - iot
  - serverless
- It is hard to define API methods. And each of those has its own method of being documented, f.e. openapi (formerly swagger) for restful-apis

# Todo

ideas:
- work on improvements for spec (this is actually tosca-simple-profile, not the tosca spec) like
  - attributes and properties are hard to distinguish. Decide for one and move the previous meaning somewhere else. For example have a statefile like terraform where actual values are noted
    from tosca-spec:
    - properties are used by template authors to provide input values to tosca entities which indicate their "desired state" when they are instantiated
    - the actual state of the entity at any poin in its lifecycle once instantiated is reflected by an attribute
    - orchestrators automatically create an attribute for every declared property (with same name)
  - create a proper documentation out of the spec document
    - overview over all types and predefined templates with use-case-description
  - create types for api-documentations (and others - don't reinvent the wheel)
  - support bare-metal -> extend tosca to hardware
    architecture is defined in os, but should be in host/processor
    (defining architecture in os is incompatible with provisioning)
  - create "shortcuts", f.e. default compute
    - has 1 nic
    - has 1 cpu with x86 arch
    - (leave ram and disk undefined)
    - can have a bios/firmware artifact/s
    - has 1 psu
    - has optional serial-number for each component
      - autoretrieve serial-numbers by installing small os and retrieving information or use ipmi or use bmc
      - "inventory"
    - zone-placement "default/main/primary"
    - backup
      - configure optional to-be-backupped / backup-worthy artifacts/nodes/... so it is well-defined what has to be backed up and what not.
      - different levels, like known_hosts and ssh/encryption-key on machine-level and secrets, dbs, data-folders on app-level
      - shortcuts for simple backups like file backups and scriptable backups like db backups
- create proper getting-started contents
- create orchestrator (not running at all times as webapp, but cli-calls)
  - opa for policies & constraints
---
reference-architecture/orchestrator:
- bare-metal / manual vm creation
- auto-retrieve information like hw-specs, serial-numbers and reachable MACs from each machine
  -> plugin #1 "information-collector" / "bookkeeper"
- enable installation of OS on hardware
  -> plugin #2 "machine-provisioner"
  - firmware installer (up- and downgrades)
  - os installer
  ?> plugin #3 "storage-provisioner" 
- enable application installation and configuration on OS
  -> plugin #4 "software-installer" (-and-configurator) (-and-updater)
  - stateless/stateful (can be used for policies, f.e. with backup rules)
  - updater might not make sense for firmwares - redeployment is often faster
- check conformity of policy-constraints like
  - HA config
  - zone-placement
  - backup
  - firmware-versions
  - network-topology (reachable MACs from each machines are already there, so connectivity can be calculated)
  - config-drift (majority has dns X set, some have Y set -> show hint)
    (define some properties at higher level, so they apply on all childs, then show childs where config is set (and different))
---
goal:
software that
  - reads a tosca-service (to be able to access information like service.compute[1].os.distribution)
  (- holds a persistent state(file))
  - extracts actions by comparing current-state and desired-state
    - "execution plan"
  - performs those actions
    - dependencies, parallelism
